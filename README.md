# Verification-of-a-One-Dimensional-Adaptive-Cruise-Control-Model-With-Applications-in-Vehicle-Platoon
Automated Verification Course Project

Traffic is a growing problem in the US and the number of phantom traffic jams is growing in tandem. One solution to reducing their number and their lasting effects involves
introducing autonomous vehicle platoons to our roadways. However, autonomous platoons are complicated systems being used in a high risk situation so their dynamics need to be
formally verified as safe in order to be used on the roads. In this paper we build a platoon model by stacking Adaptive Cruise Control models and use nuXmv to formally verify safety and
liveness specifications. While the two car model is verifiably safe, issues occur when the number of vehicles is increased. We use a simulator to visualize and analyze how these issues arise and
future solutions to address them.
